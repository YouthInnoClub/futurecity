Waste Not, Want Not: Clippers  

City Basics 

Clippers, our future city, is located at suburban of Los Angeles, California, close to the 
seashore. There are approximately 230,000 citizens (the same as Sims in future city term) that 
reside in this thriving city. Clippers rests on a flat terrain near water. Temperature generally 
varies from 30-65 degrees Fahrenheit in the colder months and 70-100 degrees Fahrenheit 
during the warmer months.   

Our city has many unique attributes that makes it an ideal city. The tax from residents 
and the money paid by tourists are the main sources of income. Tourist attractions, such as the 
theme park, central park, attracting tourists, bring in more revenues, and increasing the public 
funds. Our city attracts many tourists from all over the world, and we needed a mass transit 
system. We have the Maglev train system, which is a public transportation system run on 
magnets, as well as all electric auto driven buses, all of our major roads are underground, so 
ground space will be saved to build the parks and road for no motor vehicles (such as zero 
emission auto driven personal vehicle). We have relatively high density of population, so we 
have to built mega towers and elite mega towers, it is the mixed purposed building, which 
include the office space, retail space and residential space in one huge building, and 
surrounding by the large area of green space, such as pond and forest, park, etc. Our city has 
multiple public schools and a university, so our Sims is very well educated. Educated Sims 
generates more incomes and creates a better community. There are also police stations that 
protect Sims against crimes. We have some parks and plazas which not only increases land 
value, provide more jobs, but also generate more tax revenue for our city. We have a sewage 
sanitation system, in which most of the sewage can be filtered and treated to become drinking 
water. We also have a garbage processing system, which is our waste management system. 

Our budget is balanced, with a tax rate of ten percent. Our city is powered using our wind farm 
and solar power plants, both are natural sources of power, therefore, not causing any pollution 
or harm to the environment. We also have hospitals to heal the injured and cure the sick. We 
have a franchise manufacturing system called OmegaCo, which produces drones. Our city has 
research centers and an academy, which has lots of highly skill talents to design all kinds of 
innovative new products, such as special designed Drone. We have Trade Depots, which allows 
our city to import and export goods with other cities, some of the export goods are from our 
waste management processing center, such as products made by recyclable metal, and 
chemistry materials filtered from the burned ash, etc. Of course, we have a very slim 
government, to manage the daily public service. There are currently no unemployed or 
homeless people in our city, because we have many employment opportunities.  

Drones are a big futuristic feature and a huge contribution to the efficiency of our city. 
Our fire departments use fire-proof drones to put out fires. In case of emergency, we have 
medical drones to pick up Sims directly from home to hospital. Our police drones will flight over 
and surveillance the whole city from the sky. Occasionally, trash drones can pick up some 
specialized trash from the particular place, such as hospital or research center.

The Problem 

 Currently, solid waste management systems recycle, incinerate or dump waste into 
landfills. Landfills contain harmful toxins that seep into soil, waterways, and groundwater. 
Incinerating waste can generate hazardous gases that are being released into the air as 
pollution. Also, with our high density of population, people generate a larger amount of waste. 
The cost to maintain the current solid waste management system is too high as well. Present 
day systems not only harm the environment, but it is a health hazard for humans and animals as 
well. 

Our Solution 

The civilian engineers in our city created a more efficient solid waste management 
system as an alternative solution. Trash is collected through a pipe system to a dump and later 
the waste is sorted into categories based upon their properties. Metals are sorted out by electro
magnets and plastic, paper, organic, and inorganic materials are sorted out by a robotic arm. 
Metals, glass, plastics and papers are brought to the recycling center, and our recycling center 
modernized with artificial intelligence technology to recognize, classify and automatically sort 
the recyclable items, then the recyclable items become reusable materials or products. For 
example, old boxes can be repurposed as notebooks or folders. The organic material is 
composted into fertile soil. Some inorganic materials can be turned into building materials for 
places like parks or plazas. Any other waste materials will be moved to a facility where it will be 
incinerated and burned, the steam from burning will be used to generate power for homes and 
businesses and be cooled into safe drinking water. The ash will be turned into a fertilizer for 
plants and crops to grow. The waste gas will be created as chemistry material and traded 
through our Trade Depots. The harmful gases that the system generates is filtered out and 
absorbed. The sulfur containing solid waste was first sorted out. A major component of the 
harmful gases is carbon dioxide and that can be used to make soda (stored as dry ice). The 
solid waste management system is a large feature in our city. This system helps clean the 
waste produced by the city, and its side products bring in more income for the city.  
 
The civilian engineers assessed the possible risks of our solid waste management 
system. The robotic arms may not be one hundred percent reliable and may make a mistake in 
sorting the waste. However, if that were to happen, the engineering team will be ready to fix 
them. Another risk is that when the hazardous gases are being filtered out, there is a tiny 
amount of the hazardous gases that cannot be repurposed, which has to be released into the air 
as pollution. Ash also contains elements that can be repurposed, but also has some harmful 
elements that can be dangerous for plants if cannot be treated very well. 

The design and creation of this system required a large group of engineers. Many vitally 
important engineers are involved in this solid waste management process. Civilian engineers 
design the city wide trash collection pipe system, electrical and computer engineers create the 
robotic arms needed to sort the waste, they work together with group of chemistry engineers 
design and build the water filter system, and the incineration system, pollution control system, 
the recycling center. Agriculture engineers work to compost the waste into fertile soil. This also 
requires a group of chemists to design the process. We also needed a biologist and 
environmental scientist to monitor the impact of the solution on the environment and animals.  
When people think of Clippers, they think of an environmentally sound, safe, and energy 
efficient city. By developing this new and improved solid waste management system, the 
amount of pollution has been reduced compared to the amount of pollution generated using 
present day systems. Our system also repurposes harmful toxins, transforming them into 
something useful and harmless such as power and electricity. Citizens and tourists know 
Clippers is not only a safe city, but has many attractions to explore. The leaders of Clippers 
have successfully created an effective and environmentally sound solid waste management 
system and the ideal, futuristic city.
